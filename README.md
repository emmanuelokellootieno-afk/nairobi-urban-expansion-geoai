# GeoAI-based mapping of urban growth in Nairobi Metropolitan Region (2017-2024) using satellite embeddings and K-means clustering
Rapid urban expansion in Nairobi poses major challenges for sustainability and planning. This study maps and quantifies built-up areas across 26 subcounties of the Nairobi Metropolitan Region (2017–2024) using Google Earth Engine’s AlphaEarth Satellite Embedding dataset and unsupervised K-means clustering with 7 clusters selected via the Elbow Method. Urban areas were identified automatically each year by maximising F1 score against reference data. Validation against ESA WorldCover 2021 yielded 80% user’s accuracy and 69% F1, while Dynamic World gave 75% F1. Built-up area increased from 253.64 km² in 2017 to 391.29 km² in 2024 (54% cumulative growth, 6% AAGR). Fastest-growing subcounties: Kabete (226%), Matungulu (195%), Githunguri (194%), driven by peri-urban sprawl. Bootstrapping provided a 95% confidence interval of approximately 68–71% for F1. A supervised Random Forest baseline reached 82% F1 but required labelled data. The unsupervised embedding-based approach proves efficient and scalable for data-scarce regions, delivering actionable subcounty-level insights for urban policy and SDG11 monitoring<img width="27275" height="123" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba811f5a-43c3-4291-b311-6f57052be912" />
